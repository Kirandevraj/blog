# __Analysis of Descriptor wallets__

We begin by analyzing the performance of the Descriptor wallet. We measured the time taken for the send operation
in a regtest mode while incrementing the number of addresses in the wallet. We observed the performance of the
wallet is robust even with 50k addresses.

We moved to measure the performance of the rescanblockchain command to see how fast scanning occurs in the
blockchain when the number of addresses is around 100k. We observed that the duration only increases by 5
seconds even when the wallet holds an enormous address. The operation is to scan 1000 blocks for transactions
related to the addresses in the wallet in the mainnet.

# __Investigated an issue while Rolling Forward and possible development__

If the chain state is not properly written into the disk, the Bitcoin starts verifying the blocks once again
from the beginning to arrive at the right UTXO set. This usually happens during the initial block download
when the Bitcoin was not closed properly. PR:17487 addresses this issue where the chain state is written
into the disk once the IBD is complete.

When the chain state is not written correctly, the system will start verifying the blocks again. This will be
shown as “Rolling Forward” while starting up the Bitcoin. Here you will not be able to stop the program,
you will have to kill the process to stop the program, and when you start again, it will start processing from
the first block to obtain the UTXO set.

Hence we investigated how to make “bitcoin-cli stop” to write the chain state and stop the program in the
rolling forward situation.
